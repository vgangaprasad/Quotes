    <p><u>Conway's Law</u> - The system being produced will tend to have a structure that mirrors the structure of the group that is producing it, whether or not this was intended. One should take advantage of this fact and then deliberately design the group structure so as to achieve the desired system structure. </p>

    <p><u>Metcalfe's law</u> - The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system.</p>

    <p><u>Moore's law</u> is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years.    </p>
    
    <p><u>The Pareto principle</u> (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes</p>
    
    <p><u>Parkinson's law</u> is the adage that "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion". It is sometimes applied to the growth of bureaucracy in an organization.</p>

    <p><u>The Peter principle</u> is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence". In other words, an employee is promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. </p>

    <p><u>Social loafing</u> is the tendency for people to exert less effort when they believe there are others who will pick up the slack. Members of small teams are less prone to social loafing. Social loafing was first demonstrated by psychologist Max Ringelmann in the 1920s when he measured the pressure exerted by individuals and teams pulling on a rope. Groups of three exerted only two-and-a-half times (not three times) the average individual pressure. Groups of eight exhibited less than four times the individual average. Ringelmannâ€™s and related studies have shown that individual effort is inversely related to team size</p>
